Task:

Write a simplistic eCommerce program in JavaScript (Node) that models a Product and ShoppingCart.

Products have a name and price.
ShoppingCarts have a list of Products.
Products can be added to or removed from a ShoppingCart.
A ShoppingCart must be able to provide a total price for its list of Products.
To test the program, write two tests using Mocha:

Create a ShoppingCart, then add 2 "Apple" Products for $4.95 each and 1 "Orange" Product for $3.99, and check that the ShoppingCart total price is correct.
Create a ShoppingCart and add 3 "Apple" products, then remove 1 "Apple" product, and check that total price is correct.

The program should then be able to be tested by running:

npm test

Notes:

The code must conform to the StandardJS coding standard.
No database, user interaction, API, or other functionality is required (so no HTML/CSS); it just needs to be JS code which runs via the CLI and passes the tests.
